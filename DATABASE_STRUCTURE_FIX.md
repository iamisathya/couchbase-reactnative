# Database Structure Fix for Capella

## Problem
Your Capella database only has the `_default` collection, but the app was trying to access collections like `inventory.post`, `inventory.hotel`, etc. This caused the error:
```
Collection 'inventory.post' is not found on the remote server
```

## Solution Applied
The app has been updated to work with your database structure:

### ‚úÖ **Changes Made:**

1. **Flexible Collection Access**
   - App now tries to use specific collections first
   - Falls back to `_default` collection if specific collections don't exist
   - All data will be stored in the `_default` collection

2. **Updated Queries**
   - Posts are now stored with a `type: 'post'` field for filtering
   - Queries automatically adapt to available collections
   - No more collection-specific errors

3. **Smart Replicator Setup**
   - Automatically detects available collections
   - Uses whatever collections exist in your database
   - Provides clear logging about which collections are being used

## How It Works Now

### üì¶ **Data Storage:**
- **Posts**: Stored in `_default` collection with `type: 'post'`
- **Hotels**: Stored in `_default` collection with `type: 'hotel'`
- **Other data**: Stored in `_default` collection with appropriate type fields

### üîç **Data Retrieval:**
- App queries `_default` collection with type filters
- Example: `SELECT * FROM _default._default WHERE type = 'post'`

### üîÑ **Sync Process:**
- Syncs the `_default` collection with your Capella database
- No more collection-specific sync errors

## Testing the Fix

1. **Restart the App**
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   # or
   npm run android
   ```

2. **Check Console Logs**
   You should see:
   ```
   üìä Database opened. Found 1 collections: ['_default']
   ‚úÖ Using default collection for sync
   üì¶ Total collections for sync: 1
   üîÑ Setting up replicator with 1 collections: ['_default']
   ```

3. **Test Sync**
   - Try the "Sync from Cloud" button
   - Should work without collection errors
   - Data will be stored in the default collection

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ **Advantages:**
- **Works with your database**: No need to create additional collections
- **Simple structure**: All data in one collection with type filtering
- **Easy to manage**: Single collection to monitor and backup
- **No errors**: No more collection-specific sync issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Considerations:**
- **Performance**: Large datasets might be slower with type filtering
- **Organization**: All data types mixed in one collection
- **Scaling**: May need to restructure for very large applications

## Future Improvements

If you want to create specific collections later:

1. **In Capella Console:**
   - Go to your database
   - Create collections like `posts`, `hotels`, etc.

2. **App will automatically detect them:**
   - No code changes needed
   - App will use specific collections when available
   - Falls back to default collection if not found

## Verification

After the fix, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No more "Collection not found" errors
- ‚úÖ Successful sync operations
- ‚úÖ Data being stored and retrieved properly
- ‚úÖ Clear console logging about collection usage

## Support

If you still encounter issues:
1. Check console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify your Capella credentials are correct
3. Ensure your App Service is running
4. Test network connectivity

The app is now fully compatible with your Capella database structure!
