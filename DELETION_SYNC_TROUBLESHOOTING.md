# Deletion Sync Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔍 **Issue Analysis**

Based on your logs, the main issue is that the replicator status is showing as `undefined`, which indicates that the replicator is not properly connecting to your Capella database. Here's what's happening:

### **Current Log Analysis:**
```
🌐 Network Status Update: {isConnected: true, isInternetReachable: false, type: 'wifi', isOnline: true, isInternetReachableStrict: false}
🔍 Checking deletion sync status: {activity: undefined, hasError: false, errorMessage: 'No error message'}
🔄 Sync Status: undefined, Progress: 0/0
```

### **Root Causes:**
1. **Replicator Status Undefined**: The replicator is not properly connecting to Capella
2. **Network Connectivity**: `isInternetReachable: false` suggests network issues
3. **Connection Timeout**: The replicator may be timing out during connection

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Enhanced Status Detection**
- Added better handling for undefined replicator status
- Improved error detection and reporting
- Added connection checks before sync operations

### **2. Improved Force Sync Deletions**
- Added replicator connection verification
- Better timeout handling
- More detailed status logging

### **3. Enhanced Replicator Listener**
- Better handling of undefined activity levels
- More detailed error reporting
- Connection state tracking

## 🚀 **Testing the Fixes**

### **Step 1: Restart the App**
```bash
# Stop the current app and restart
npm run ios
# or
npm run android
```

### **Step 2: Check Initial Connection**
Look for these logs in the console:
```
🔍 Validating Capella Configuration...
✅ Capella configuration validated successfully
🔄 Setting up replicator with 1 collections: ['_default']
🔄 Sync Status: CONNECTING - Establishing connection...
```

### **Step 3: Test Clear All Posts**
1. Add some posts to the app
2. Click "Clear All" button
3. Watch the console logs for improved status reporting

## 📊 **Expected New Logs**

### **Successful Connection:**
```
🔍 Replicator connection check: {
  hasReplicator: true,
  activity: "CONNECTING",
  isConnected: true,
  error: "No error"
}
🔄 Sync Status: CONNECTING - Establishing connection...
🔄 Sync Status: BUSY - Syncing data...
✅ Sync Status: IDLE - Sync completed successfully
```

### **Improved Deletion Sync:**
```
🔍 Checking deletion sync status (1/30): {
  activity: "BUSY",
  hasError: false,
  errorMessage: "No error message",
  progress: "5/10"
}
✅ Deletion sync completed successfully
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Steps**

### **If Still Getting Undefined Status:**

#### **1. Check Network Connectivity**
```javascript
// In the app console, check:
NetworkService.getDetailedNetworkInfo()
```

#### **2. Verify Capella Configuration**
```javascript
// Check if configuration is loaded correctly:
getCapellaConfig()
```

#### **3. Test Replicator Connection**
```javascript
// Check replicator status:
dbService.isReplicatorConnected()
```

#### **4. Manual Connection Test**
```javascript
// Try manual sync:
dbService.triggerSimpleSync()
```

### **Common Issues and Solutions:**

#### **Issue: "Replicator status is undefined"**
**Solution:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify Capella App Service is running
3. Ensure credentials are correct
4. Try restarting the app

#### **Issue: "isInternetReachable: false"**
**Solution:**
1. Try switching between WiFi and cellular
2. Check if your network blocks WebSocket connections
3. Test with a different network

#### **Issue: "Connection timeout"**
**Solution:**
1. Check your Capella App Service status
2. Verify the endpoint URL is correct
3. Ensure the user has proper permissions

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **1. Test the Improved Deletion Sync**
- The new implementation should provide better error messages
- It will detect connection issues more quickly
- It will attempt to reconnect if needed

### **2. Monitor the Logs**
- Watch for the new detailed status messages
- Look for connection establishment logs
- Check for any specific error messages

### **3. Verify Capella Sync**
- Check your Capella dashboard to see if deletions are syncing
- Look for documents being removed from your bucket
- Verify the sync is working in both directions

## 📋 **Verification Checklist**

- [ ] App starts without configuration errors
- [ ] Replicator connects successfully (CONNECTING → BUSY → IDLE)
- [ ] Network status shows as online
- [ ] Clear All posts works without undefined status
- [ ] Deletions sync to Capella successfully
- [ ] No timeout errors during sync operations

## 🔧 **If Issues Persist**

If you're still experiencing issues after these fixes:

1. **Check Capella Console**: Ensure your App Service is running
2. **Verify User Permissions**: Make sure `appserviceuser` has proper access
3. **Test Network**: Try on a different network
4. **Check Firewall**: Ensure WebSocket connections are allowed
5. **Review Logs**: Look for specific error messages in the console

The improved error handling and connection detection should help identify the exact cause of any remaining issues.
